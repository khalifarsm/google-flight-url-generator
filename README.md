# Google Flight URL Generator (REST API)

This project is a REST API-based Google Flights URL generator built using the logic from the original [Google Flights URL Generator](https://github.com/jjshammas/google-flights-url-generator) by [jjshammas](https://github.com/jjshammas).

## üîÑ Key Difference

Unlike the original project, which is designed as a JavaScript module, this project provides a **standalone REST API**. This approach makes it easier to use the functionality in environments that are not JavaScript-based, particularly Java applications.

## ‚ùì Why This Project?

While building a Java application, I needed the ability to generate Google Flights URLs. The original tool was JavaScript-based and could not be used directly in a Java environment. To address this, I created a REST API that wraps the original logic, enabling language-agnostic integration.

## üöÄ How to Run

To quickly run the API using Docker:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/khalifarsm/google-flight-url-generator:latest
docker run -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/khalifarsm/google-flight-url-generator:latest
```
